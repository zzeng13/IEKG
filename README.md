# IEKG  
  
Data and knowledge model implementation for IEKG -- the **I**diomatic **E**xpression **K**nowledge **G**raph. 
  
  
## Description  
  
This repo contains the data and knowledge modeling implementation for the Idiomatic Expression Knowledge Graph from the paper: *IEKG: A Commonsense Knowledge Graph for Idiomatic Expressions*.  
  
The paper is published in EMNLP 2023. Please refer to the [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.881/) for more details.  
  
The formatted data for IEKG is in: `./iekg_data/iekg_knowledge_tuples_processed.jsonl` . The data file contain a list of directiories in which each data instance is a knowledge tuple in the following format: 
```
{
        "idiomatic_event": "PersonX wins by a hair's breadth",
        "relation_type": "xAttr",
        "annotation": "Ambitious",
        "idiom": "a hair's breadth",
        "defn": "A very small amount or short length"
}
```
where `idiomatic_event`, `relation_type`, and `annotation` are the head, relation and tail annotation of the knowledge tuple and `idiom` contains the original idiom and `defn` contains its definition as supplied by the annotators.

The implementation of the knowledge model training is under the direction `./code_km`. Please see the `README.md` under the directory for more details.
